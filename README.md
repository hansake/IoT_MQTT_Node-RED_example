# IoT_MQTT_Node-RED_example
IoT example with Raspberry Pi and Arduino using MQTT and Node-RED

This is a very simple IoT example using Arduino UNO for digital input and output.
The control program is running on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ using Node-RED.
Communication between RPi and Arduino is with MQTT using the Mosquitto MQTT broker
